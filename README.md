In the given example below we gather 70 images for the one gesture(Similarily it needs to be done for all the gestures)

python ImagesP.py one 70


4.We train the model using 

python TrainP.py

5.Test the model on some images whether it is predicting right or wrong 

python TestP.py <path_to_test_image>

6.Play the game with the computer 

python PlayP.py
